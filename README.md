# Starter 2


# Dependencies

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/): This template uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) instead of `npm` for dependencies management.
* [Webpack 3+](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/): Optional but helpful on some frameworks that come with gulp as part of their development platform.

# Running

To run locally use `npm run build` or `npm run watch`. If you prefer gulp you can use `gulp` and `gulp watch` instead.

# Dist

Assets used by the site.

### Images

The images directory `dist/img` is broken into a couple starting folders based on common uses. These can be altered at any time to provide better project organization.

* `content`: Images that would be viewed as 'editorial' or are primarily content based. Not part of the styling or theming of the site.
* `global`: Images `global.css` uses directly or relies on.
* `meta`: Images used by the site's meta tags or sharing.
